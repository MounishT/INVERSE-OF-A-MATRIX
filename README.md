# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
import numpy
### Step 2: 
Define the matrix for which you want to find the inverse
### Step 3:
use the numpy.linlag.inv()function to find the inverse of the matrix
### Step 4: 
Display the result
## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by:T Mounish 
#RegisterNumber:23002806
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]])
result = np.linalg.inv(A)
print(result)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
